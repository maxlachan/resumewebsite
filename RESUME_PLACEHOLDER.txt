IMPORTANT: ADD YOUR RESUME PDF HERE

To enable the "Download Resume" button functionality:

1. Save your resume as a PDF file
2. Name it: Steve_Paul_Resume.pdf
3. Place it in this public/ folder

The download button in index.html is already configured to link to this file.

Alternatively, if you want to use a different filename:
- Update the href attribute in index.html (line ~59)
- Change: href="Steve_Paul_Resume.pdf"
- To: href="your-filename.pdf"
